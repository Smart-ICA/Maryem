## 🔧 3. Arduino Programs
---
The folder `Arduino/` contains the two independent firmwares used to acquire raw sensor data required by the MADS acquisition pipeline.

Two **Arduino Uno boards** are used simultaneously, each connected on a different serial port and streaming newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON).

### 🛰️ Arduino Uno 1 – Accelerations + Machine Sound

🔌 **Serial Port:** `/dev/ttyACM0`

📄 **File:** `Micro2_Accelerometre_JSON.ino`

This Arduino reads:

* 3-axis accelerations of the CNC machine
* Sound level measured directly on the machine structure

It packages the measurements into the following JSON frame:

```json
{
  "millis": ...,
  "acceleration": { "x_g": ..., "y_g": ..., "z_g": ... },
  "sound_level": ...
}
```

**Fields:**

* `millis` → Arduino internal timestamp
* `acceleration.x_g / y_g / z_g` → vibrations in g
* `sound_level` → machine acoustic vibration level

---

### 🛰️ Arduino Uno 2 – Current, Power & External Sound

🔌 **Serial Port:** `/dev/ttyACM1`

📄 **File:**  `Current_Micro1_JSON.ino`

This Arduino is dedicated to:

* Measuring the spindle current using DFRobot analog current sensor SCT-013 20A 
* Computing instantaneous power using
  `P = √3 × U × I × cosφ`, with `U = 250 V`, `cosφ ≈ 0.85`
* Recording the external environmental sound level near the CNC machine

It sends JSON frames of the form:

```json
{
  "millis": ...,
  "I_A": ...,
  "P_W": ...,
  "sound_level": ...
}
```

**Fields:**

* `I_A` → RMS spindle current (A)
* `P_W` → computed electrical power (W)
* `sound_level` → external acoustic level near the CNC
